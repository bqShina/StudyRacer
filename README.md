## 🔭 About the Project
StudyRacer is a web app designed to engage students in managing their academic tasks. By gamifying homework, it transforms studying into a competitive race, making it enjoyable and motivating. The app tracks progress and provides insights, helping students meet their deadlines effectively.

## 💭 Problem Definition
Students struggle with time management, leading to missed deadlines and poor academic performance. StudyRacer helps students stay on top of their work by tracking progress and turning homework into a fun, competitive experience.

🎯 Main Goal: Encourage students to complete assignments efficiently by making the process engaging and motivating.

## 💡 Core Concept
### Gamification + To-do Tracker + Progress Tracking
StudyRacer will incorporate elements of competition (leaderboards, progress tracking) and fun rewards (badges, confetti effects) to motivate students to complete tasks on time.

### Features:
- Gamified task list (similar to a to-do app, but with points, rewards, and leveling up)
- Automatic progress tracking
- Leaderboards to create competition between users
- Verification system to ensure that students complete tasks correctly before earning points
